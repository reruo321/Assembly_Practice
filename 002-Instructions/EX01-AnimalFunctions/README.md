# Example 01 - AnimalFunctions
The example shows simple example functions, which are the answers of [Problem 1 from the Internet](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-s03/www/asm_examples.pdf).
You can call these and test some cases using main.cpp I added.

## 1. goose()
    int goose(){ return -4; }

The first function goose() should return -4. If the assembly code is written correctly, it should be called and return the value on the C++ main function.
